//! Reading a Mesocosm body profile (`mesocosm.body/v0`) into [`Voxels`] +
//! [`Palette`].
//!
//! A sibling of [`load_vox`](crate::load_vox), and the same kind of thing: an
//! importer for somebody else's format. `.vox` is the authoring input a person
//! makes in MagicaVoxel; a body profile is the artifact another *game* emits,
//! carried as a part of a `mere.pack/v1` bundle.
//!
//! # Why this crate owns no Mesocosm types
//!
//! The games wing ruled that its vessels **couple by data, not by types**.
//! Isometry is a general VTT; depending on one specific game's crates to read
//! its output would invert that, and would make every future writer a new
//! dependency instead of a new file.
//!
//! The primitive layout lives in the product-free `wing-formats` crate. This
//! importer keeps only its voxel projection and its product-local errors.
//!
//! # Axes agree, and that was checked
//!
//! `.vox` needs an axis remap because MagicaVoxel is Z-up. Mesocosm is **Y-up**
//! like we are — its `Above` facing is axis 1, and its yaw rotates about axis 1
//! — and its grids use the same `x + y * dx + z * dx * dy` cell order. So this
//! importer copies straight across. That is verified against Mesocosm's body
//! and plan modules, not assumed from the array shapes lining up.
//!
//! # Refusal, not best effort
//!
//! Coupling by data trades a compile error for a runtime one, so the reader has
//! to be the one that notices. The header is a fixed 8-byte magic plus a
//! little-endian `u16` version, checked *before* any payload decoding, so a
//! profile from a newer writer is diagnosed as a version disagreement rather
//! than mis-decoded into plausible nonsense.
