//! Creatures arriving from Mesocosm, and the history this campaign adds to
//! them.
//!
//! A sibling of [`isometry_voxel::body`], and the other half of the same seam.
//! A body profile carries what a creature *looks like*; a chronicle carries
//! what it *is and did*. Appearance goes to the voxel lane, the record comes
//! here, and neither needs the other.
//!
//! # The roster slot is the one we already had
//!
//! An arriving creature becomes a [`WorldCharacter`] — the same struct an
//! authored NPC uses, with the same fields, stored the same way. That is not a
//! convenience; it is the point. The games wing's third law says player history
//! *displaces* procedural content and never gates it, and the proof it demands
//! is that the consuming game cannot tell a played creature from a generated
//! one. A separate `ImportedCharacter` type would fail that test by existing.
//!
//! Note where the arrival lands: `WorldCharacter` carries a `faction`. A
//! creature that joins one becomes a character in the wing's exact sense — a
//! faction-associated borg — so this seam is where that promotion happens.
//!
//! # Nothing here links Mesocosm
//!
//! The wing couples vessels through the product-free primitive layout in
//! `wing-formats`. Postcard remains positional, so framing precedes decoding.
//!
//! # Appending, never editing
//!
//! [`Arrival::record`] is the only way this crate changes a chronicle. Deeds
//! written by other games are carried out exactly as they came in, including
//! payloads nothing here can parse. That is the keystone rule — additive facts,
//! opaque preservation — and the reason a creature can cross three games
//! without anybody's history being quietly dropped.
