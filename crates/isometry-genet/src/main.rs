//! Isometry's genet desktop host (bootstrap plan I1).
//!
//! A winit window presenting the board screen over live state:
//! `GenetAppRunner` diffs `isometry_views::board_root` into a
//! `ScriptedDom`, a retained `IncrementalLayout` lays it out at logical
//! size (incremental `apply` for attribute-only batches, so a camera pan
//! stays off the rebuild path), paint emission lowers to a
//! `netrender::Scene`, and `genet-winit-host`'s `SurfaceHost` rasterizes
//! and composites onto the backbuffer. Borrowed from the woodshed-genet
//! harness shape.
//!
//! Sessions (I4): `--host` binds an iroh session and prints a join
//! ticket; `--join <ticket>` dials it. `--campaign <name>` restores that
//! campaign's durable checkpoint before a host accepts peers. In a session the view is Remote —
//! play routes through the host authority (`net` module bridges the
//! async session to this sync loop). Env hooks: `ISOMETRY_PROFILE=1`
//! (frame timers + net trace), `ISOMETRY_CAPTURE_DIR` (self-capture),
//! `ISOMETRY_SYNTH=1` (stress board), `ISOMETRY_NET_SELFTEST=1` (fire one
//! end-turn after warm-up to verify the session round-trip without OS
//! input automation), `ISOMETRY_OVERMAP_SELFTEST=1` (overmap capture), and
//! `ISOMETRY_OVERMAP_SOURCE_TIME_SELFTEST=1` (historical-overmap capture).
